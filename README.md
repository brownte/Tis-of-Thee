# Tis-of-Thee
Tis of Thee is an Android application designed to allow a user to scroll through a list of countries, select one, and then pick criteria on which to receive further details about their country.

**Overview**

This application was intended to satisfy the Onramp requirements through utilization of the MVP design pattern; however, due to the learning curve of Android Studio and Kotlin, I was unable to complete my code, refactor it, and then decouple it to populate my Presenter, Views, and Repositories to specification. When implemented correctly, MVP is utilized to separate the model and view, allowing them to communicate only through the presenter. 

GraphQL was utilized to pull information from Trevor Blades' API (https://countries.trevorblades.com/) with two queries:
1) getCountryAndFlagQuery - This query populates the RecyclerView Fragment within the Main Activity (returns Country name, Country code, and flag).
2) getResultsQuery - This query would execute after the Get Info button was pressed. This would be based on the Country code selected in the first query and would return Country name, native name, phone number dialing code, continent name, capital, currency, name of primary language used, and flag.

Currently, the Adapters are being used to hold the logic to generate the API. There are presenters for the Main and Results activities where the methods generated by the Contract interfaces were declared (but not used - I spent too much time researching items that were giving me difficulties). Repositories were created to hold the responses from the Apollo calls; however, they are disconnected (as mentioned above, I intended to refactor this program to functionally decompose everything, but ran out of time).

The 5 UI components I was intending to implement were:
1) Bottom navigation bar <br/>
  a) The home button - contains the Main Activity<br/>
  b) The results button - While actively on the home page, the user would not be able to click the results page until the get info button was pressed. Upon clicking get info, the user would be taken to the results activity where their requested information would be available. While on the results page, the icon would update to a checkmark; however, once the user navigated back to the main page, the results icon would change from a checkmark back to a "no results" symbol.
2) Chips â€“ user selection elements that house the names of available information about a selected country.
3) Button - User presses this button to retrieve the information selected within their chips.
4) Progress bar - shows status of the return for the get results query (resulting from the get info button).
5) Cards - RecyclerView elements within Fragment were stored inside of Cards.
6) On the main page there would have been a switch to set the state of shared preferences. After the application was destroyed and then resumed, the home page would have opened with android:enabled="true" coded for the previously selected chips. I didn't get a chance to try and add this.

Two activities were utilized with one Fragment:
1) Main Activity - houses the RecyclerView Fragment that pulls in the list of countries, flags, and their flag codes. After the country is selected, the color of the card view containing the country changes, and then the user can select from a list of chips containing the information they want retrieved for their country.

2) Results Activity - houses list of TextView results contingent on elections made by the user on the Main Activity page.
